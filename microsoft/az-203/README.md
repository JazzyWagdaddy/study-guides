## Considerations Before You Begin Studying
This exam is meant to be take by a practitioner. You most likely need at least one (1) year of experience in development. Do you need to know everything? No, you don't, but having C# under your belt with working knowledge of Azure SDKs is going to be a prerquisite to passing the exam.

If you don't or have never written code, the exam is going to be a big challenge for you.

## About This Study Guide

I'm not going to focus on things like exam structure, pricing, yada yada. You can easily find this information with a search or directly on the Microsoft learning site. What I'll focus on is the resources that target the topics covered by the exam, and my opinion on what you should be focusing on during the course of your study time.
