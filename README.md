## About Me

I am a Senior Cloud Solution Architect for Microsoft and have nearly 16 years of experience building applications and distributed systems both in the cloud and on-premises. I've have contributed code to the Azure Functions service. I'm also a Certified Microsoft Azure Solutions Architect (I have taken all exams cold and successfully passed so I'm not just blowing smoke here). I'm passionate about building systems and telling a story through code so that others can gain meaningful understanding of it's intent, ultimately making it stable and maintainable.
